webpack 2\nnpm install --save-dev extract-text-webpack-plugin@2.1.2\n# for webpack 1\nnpm install --save-dev extract-text-webpack-plugin@1.0.1\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n> :warning: For webpack v1, see [the README in the webpack-1 branch](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin/blob/webpack-1/README.md).\n\n```js\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require(\"extract-text-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n          fallback: \"style-loader\",\n          use: \"css-loader\"\n        })\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new ExtractTextPlugin(\"styles.css\"),\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIt moves all the required `*.css` modules in entry chunks into a separate CSS file. So your styles are no longer inlined into the JS bundle, but in a separate CSS file (`styles.css`). If your total stylesheet volume is big, it will be faster because the CSS bundle is loaded in parallel to the JS bundle.\n\n|Advantages|Caveats|\n|:---------|:------|\n| Fewer style tags (older IE has a limit) | Additional HTTP request |\n| CSS SourceMap (with `devtool: \"source-map\"` and `extract-text-webpack-plugin?sourceMap`) | Longer compilation time |\n| CSS requested in parallel | No runtime public path modification |\n| CSS cached separate | No Hot Module Replacement |\n| Faster runtime (less code and DOM operations) | ... |\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\n```js\nnew ExtractTextPlugin(options: filename | object)\n```\n\n|Name|Type|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:----------|\n|**`id`**|`{String}`|Unique ident for this plugin instance.

Supports loaders of type `{ loader: [name]-loader -> {String}, options: {} -> {Object} }`.\n\n|Name|Type|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:----------|\n|**`options.use`**|`{String}`/`{Array}`/`{Object}`|Loader(s) that should be used for converting the resource to a CSS exporting module _(required)_|\n|**`options.fallback`**|`{String}`/`{Array}`/`{Object}`|loader(e.g `'style-loader'`) that should be used when the CSS is not extracted (i.e. in an additional chunk when `allChunks: false`)|\n|**`options.publicPath`**|`{String}`|Override the `publicPath` setting for this loader|\n\n\n#### Multiple Instances\n\nThere is also an `extract` function on the instance. You should use this if you have more than one instance of  `ExtractTextPlugin`.\n\n```js\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');\n\n// Create multiple instances\nconst extractCSS = new ExtractTextPlugin('stylesheets/[name]-one.css');\nconst extractLESS = new ExtractTextPlugin('stylesheets/[name]-two.css');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        use: extractCSS.extract([ 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader' ])\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.less$/i,\n        use: extractLESS.extract([ 'css-loader', 'less-loader' ])\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    extractCSS,\n    extractLESS\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n### Extracting Sass or LESS\n\nThe configuration is the same, switch out `sass-loader` for `less-loader` when necessary.\n\n```js\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.scss$/,\n        use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n          fallback: 'style-loader',\n          use: ['css-loader', 'sass-loader']\n        })\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new ExtractTextPlugin('style.css')\n    //if you want to pass in options, you can do so:\n    //new ExtractTextPlugin({\n    //  filename: 'style.css'\n    //})\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### `url()` Resolving\n\nIf you are finding that urls are not resolving properly when you run webpack. You can expand your loader functionality with options. The `url: false` property allows your paths resolved without any changes.\n\n```js\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.scss$/,\n        use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n          fallback: 'style-loader',\n          use: [\n            {\n                loader: 'css-loader',\n                options: {\n                    // If you are having trouble with urls not resolving add this setting.\n                    // See https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader#url\n                    url: false,\n                    minimize: true,\n                    sourceMap: true\n                }\n            }, \n            {\n                loader: 'sass-loader',\n                options: {\n                    sourceMap: true\n                }\n            }\n          ]\n        })\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Modify filename\n\n`filename` parameter could be `Function`. It passes `getPath` to process the format like `css/[name].css` and returns the real file name, `css/js/a.css`. You can replace `css/js` with `css` then you will get the new path `css/a.css`.\n\n\n```js\nentry: {\n  'js/a': \"./a\"\n},\nplugins: [\n  new ExtractTextPlugin({\n    filename:  (getPath) => {\n      return getPath('css/[name].css').replace('css/js', 'css');\n    },\n    allChunks: true\n  })\n]\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td
