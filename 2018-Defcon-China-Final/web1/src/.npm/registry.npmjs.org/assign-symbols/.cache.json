Can be used as a supplement to other extend, assign or merge methods as a polyfill for the Symbols part of the es6 Object.assign method.\n\nFrom the [Mozilla Developer docs for Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol):\n\n> A symbol is a unique and immutable data type and may be used as an identifier for object properties. The symbol object is an implicit object wrapper for the symbol primitive data type.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n\n```sh\n$ npm i assign-symbols --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar assignSymbols = require('assign-symbols');\nvar obj = {};\n\nvar one = {};\nvar symbolOne = Symbol('aaa');\none[symbolOne] = 'bbb';\n\nvar two = {};\nvar symbolTwo = Symbol('ccc');\ntwo[symbolTwo] = 'ddd';\n\nassignSymbols(obj, one, two);\n\nconsole.log(obj[symbolOne]);\n//=> 'bbb'\nconsole.log(obj[symbolTwo]);\n//=> 'ddd'\n```\n\n## Similar projects\n\n* [assign-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assign-deep): Deeply assign the enumerable properties of source objects to a destination object. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep)\n* [clone-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clone-deep): Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep)\n* [extend-shallow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow)\n* [merge-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/merge-deep): Recursively merge values in a javascript object. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/merge-deep)\n* [mixin-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mixin-deep): Deeply mix the properties of objects into the first object.
