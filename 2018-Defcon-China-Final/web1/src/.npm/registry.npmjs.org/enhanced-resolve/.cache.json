Options/defaults can be seen below */\r\n});\r\n\r\n// resolve a file with the new resolver\r\nconst context = {};\r\nconst resolveContext = {};\r\nconst lookupStartPath = '/Users/webpack/some/root/dir';\r\nconst request = './path/to-look-up.js';\r\nmyResolver.resolve({}, lookupStartPath, request, resolveContext, (err/*Error*/, filepath/*string*/) => {\r\n  // Do something with the path\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more examples creating different types resolvers (sync/async, context, etc) see `lib/node.js`.\r\n#### Resolver Options\r\n| Field                    | Default                     | Description                                                                        |\r\n| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| alias                    | []                          | A list of module alias configurations or an object which maps key to value |\r\n| aliasFields              | []                          | A list of alias fields in description files |\r\n| cacheWithContext         | true                        | If unsafe cache is enabled, includes `request.context` in the cache key  |\r\n| descriptionFiles         | [\"package.json\"]            | A list of description files to read from |\r\n| enforceExtension         | false                       | Enforce that a extension from extensions must be used |\r\n| enforceModuleExtension   | false                       | Enforce that a extension from moduleExtensions must be used |\r\n| extensions               | [\".js\", \".json\", \".node\"]   | A list of extensions which should be tried for files |\r\n| mainFields               | [\"main\"]                    | A list of main fields in description files |\r\n| mainFiles                | [\"index\"]                   | A list of main files in directories |\r\n| modules                  | [\"node_modules\"]            | A list of directories to resolve modules from, can be absolute path or folder name |\r\n| unsafeCache              | false                       | Use this cache object to unsafely cache the successful requests |\r\n| plugins                  | []                          | A list of additional resolve plugins which should be applied |\r\n| symlinks                 | false                       | Whether to resolve symlinks to their symlinked location |\r\n| cachePredicate           | function() { return true }; | A function which decides whether a request should be cached or not.

These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.\r\n\r\nA plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.\r\n\r\n### Plugin Boilerplate\r\n```js\r\nclass MyResolverPlugin {\r\n  constructor(source, target) {\r\n    this.source = source;\r\n    this.target = target;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  apply(resolver) {\r\n    resolver.plugin(this.source, (request, callback) => {\r\n      // Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here\r\n      resolver.doResolve(this.target, request, null, callback);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Passing options from webpack\r\nIf you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresolve: {\r\n  extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],\r\n  modules: ['src', 'node_modules'],\r\n  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]\r\n  ...\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2016 Tobias Koppers\r\n\r\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bebraw","email":"bebraw@gmail.com"},{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-03-21T16:11:50.127Z","created":"2012-08-13T14:52:09.649Z","0.2.0":"2012-08-13T14:52:12.474Z","0.2.1":"2012-08-13T15:08:09.344Z","0.2.2":"2012-08-13T15:24:29.055Z","0.2.3":"2012-08-23T16:41:32.834Z","0.2.4":"2012-09-13T10:03:08.611Z","0.2.5":"2012-09-24T13:27:20.110Z","0.2.6":"2012-09-24T13:29:10.026Z","0.2.7":"2012-09-24T13:36:26.294Z","0.2.8":"2012-09-25T17:17:50.406Z","0.2.9":"2012-09-26T09:33:15.397Z","0.3.0":"2012-10-27T00:18:47.923Z","0.3.1":"2012-10-30T18:54:15.926Z","0.4.0":"2012-10-31T12:17:03.703Z","0.4.1":"2012-11-01T23:26:29.972Z","0.4.2":"2012-11-06T00:38:05.522Z","0.4.4":"2012-11-06T10:21:51.065Z","0.4.5":"2012-11-06T11:02:38.971Z","0.4.6":"2012-11-12T21:10:11.170Z","0.4.7":"2012-11-13T23:00:56.904Z","0.4.8":"2012-11-19T11:24:12.005Z","0.4.9":"2012-11-22T14:49:38.078Z","0.4.10":"2012-11-23T21:58:18.767Z","0.4.11":"2013-01-21T08:05:34.762Z","0.4.12":"2013-01-21T08:14:41.526Z","0.5.0":"2013-02-01T07:30:49.886Z","0.5.1":"2013-02-04T09:43:58.930Z","0.5.2":"2013-02-04T12:40:13.372Z","0.5.3":"2013-02-13T14:17:51.862Z","0.5.4":"2013-02-17T09:28:36.702Z","0.5.5":"2013-02-19T12:49:24.501Z","0.5.6":"2013-02-19T12:54:07.144Z","0.5.7":"2013-02-20T20:40:22.399Z","0.5.8":"2013-02-23T23:20:17.447Z","0.5.9":"2013-05-12T20:33:37.853Z","0.5.10":"2013-05-13T12:20:12.199Z","0.5.11":"2013-07-04T09:58:27.634Z","0.5.12":"2013-07-05T06:05:07.452Z","0.5.13":"2013-10-14T20:13:21.584Z","0.5.14":"2013-11-08T08:28:17.723Z","0.5.15":"2013-12-02T08:02:35.934Z","0.6.0":"2014-01-10T08:09:23.100Z","0.6.1":"2014-01-21T14:00:08.422Z","0.7.0":"2014-02-11T11:13:33.552Z","0.7.1":"2014-02-17T11:48:07.671Z","0.7.2":"2014-02-19T20:28:19.621Z","0.7.3":"2014-03-11T17:33:42.579Z","0.7.4":"2014-04-18T08:42:17.561Z","0.7.5":"2014-05-29T20:11:17.868Z","0.7.6":"2014-08-12T12:50:50.304Z","0.8.0":"2015-01-16T23:21:48.693Z","0.8.1":"2015-01-17T10:42:57.796Z","0.8.2":"2015-01-17T16:19:11.559Z","0.8.3":"2015-01-17T20:06:07.351Z","0.8.4":"2015-01-21T10:06:55.661Z","0.8.5":"2015-04-08T19:17:50.725Z","0.8.6":"2015-05-03T21:05:43.435Z","0.9.0":"2015-07-23T21:15:20.669Z","0.9.1":"2015-10-21T22:48:49.269Z","2.0.0":"2016-01-03T16:53:55.950Z","2.0.1":"2016-01-03T20:20:26.328Z","2.0.2":"2016-01-03T20:35:30.937Z","2.1.0":"2016-01-19T23:36:29.542Z","2.2.0":"2016-01-26T16:51:02.680Z","2.2.1":"2016-01-26T18:19:26.404Z","2.2.2":"2016-02-04T22:32:33.290Z","2.3.0":"2016-09-07T16:08:09.618Z","3.0.0":"2016-12-06T17:36:23.072Z","3.0.1":"2016-12-14T12:16:48.951Z","3.0.2":"2016-12-15T23:47:26.030Z","3.0.3":"2017-01-11T10:09:07.760Z","3.1.0":"2017-02-03T11:46:58.569Z","3.2.0":"2017-07-01T12:12:58.750Z","3.3.0":"2017-07-01T15:07:54.524Z","3.4.0":"2017-07-24T08:03:01.181Z","3.4.1":"2017-07-24T12:34:32.659Z","4.0.0-beta.1":"2017-11-29T15:29:11.756Z","4.0.0-beta.2":"2017-11-30T07:53:08.822Z","4.0.0-beta.3":"2018-01-04T16:12:59.761Z","4.0.0-beta.4":"2018-01-04T19:57:51.068Z","4.0.0":"2018-02-22T08:01:57.771Z"},"author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"http://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve","users":{"xueboren":true,"akinhwan":true},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve/issues"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5ab28446-1a1b0\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 16:11:50 GMT"}
