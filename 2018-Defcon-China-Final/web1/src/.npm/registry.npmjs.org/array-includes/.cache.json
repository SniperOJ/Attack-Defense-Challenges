support][testling-svg]][testling-url]\n\nAn ES7/ES2016 spec-compliant `Array.prototype.includes` shim/polyfill/replacement that works as far down as ES3.\n\nThis package implements the [es-shim API](https://github.com/es-shims/api) interface. It works in an ES3-supported environment and complies with the proposed [spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/).\n\nBecause `Array.prototype.includes` depends on a receiver (the `this` value), the main export takes the array to operate on as the first argument.\n\n## Getting started\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save array-includes\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nBasic usage: **includes(array, value[, fromIndex=0])**\n\n```js\nvar includes = require('array-includes');\nvar arr = [ 'one', 'two' ];\n\nincludes(arr, 'one'); // true\nincludes(arr, 'three'); // false\nincludes(arr, 'one', 1); // false\n```\n\n\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar includes = require('array-includes');\nvar assert = require('assert');\nvar arr = [\n\t1,\n\t'foo',\n\tNaN,\n\t-0\n];\n\nassert.equal(arr.indexOf(0) > -1, true);\nassert.equal(arr.indexOf(-0) > -1, true);\nassert.equal(includes(arr, 0), true);\nassert.equal(includes(arr, -0), true);\n\nassert.equal(arr.indexOf(NaN) > -1, false);\nassert.equal(includes(arr, NaN), true);\n\nassert.equal(includes(arr, 'foo', 0), true);\nassert.equal(includes(arr, 'foo', 1), true);\nassert.equal(includes(arr, 'foo', 2), false);\n```\n\n```js\nvar includes = require('array-includes');\nvar assert = require('assert');\n/* when Array#includes is not present */\ndelete Array.prototype.includes;\nvar shimmedIncludes = includes.shim();\n\nassert.equal(shimmedIncludes, includes.getPolyfill());\nassert.deepEqual(arr.includes('foo', 1), includes(arr, 'foo', 1));\n```\n\n```js\nvar includes = require('array-includes');\nvar assert = require('assert');\n/* when Array#includes is present */\nvar shimmedIncludes = includes.shim();\n\nassert.equal(shimmedIncludes, Array.prototype.includes);\nassert.deepEqual(arr.includes(1, 'foo'), includes(arr, 1, 'foo'));\n```\n\n## Tests\nSimply clone the repo, `npm install`, and run `npm test`\n\n[package-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/array-includes\n[npm-version-svg]: http://versionbadg.es/ljharb/array-includes.svg\n[travis-svg]: https://travis-ci.org/ljharb/array-includes.svg\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/ljharb/array-includes\n[deps-svg]: https://david-dm.org/ljharb/array-includes.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/ljharb/array-includes\n[dev-deps-svg]: https://david-dm.org/ljharb/array-includes/dev-status.svg\n[dev-deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/ljharb/array-includes#info=devDependencies\n[testling-svg]: https://ci.testling.com/ljharb/array-includes.png\n[testling-url]: https://ci.testling.com/ljharb/array-includes\n[npm-badge-png]: https://nodei.co/npm/array-includes.png?downloads=true&stars=true\n[license-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/l/array-includes.svg\n[license-url]: LICENSE\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/array-includes.svg\n[downloads-url]: http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=array-includes\n","maintainers":[{"name":"ljharb","email":"ljharb@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-04-19T06:45:34.094Z","created":"2015-01-04T09:18:18.192Z","1.0.0":"2015-01-04T09:18:18.192Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-04T09:54:24.431Z","1.0.2":"2015-01-06T07:20:03.498Z","1.0.3":"2015-01-07T00:22:14.775Z","1.0.4":"2015-01-11T03:19:02.714Z","1.0.5":"2015-01-30T09:59:19.813Z","1.0.6":"2015-02-17T10:59:16.880Z","1.1.0":"2015-03-19T10:06:40.476Z","1.1.1":"2015-05-23T23:30:49.693Z","2.0.0":"2015-05-24T03:01:56.892Z","3.0.0":"2015-08-16T05:51:30.287Z","3.0.1":"2015-08-16T19:30:52.692Z","3.0.2":"2016-02-06T09:53:06.343Z","3.0.3":"2017-04-19T06:45:34.094Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ljharb/array-includes#readme","keywords":["Array.prototype.includes","includes","array","ES7","shim","polyfill","contains","Array.prototype.contains","es-shim API"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/ljharb/array-includes.git"},"author":{"name":"Jordan Harband","email":"ljharb@gmail.com","url":"http://ljharb.codes"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ljharb/array-includes/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","contributors":[{"name":"Jordan Harband","email":"ljharb@gmail.com","url":"http://ljharb.codes"}],"users":{"stone_breaker":true,"shakakira":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"58f7078e-8a57\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 6:45:34 GMT"}
